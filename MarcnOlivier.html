                                       Marc was already there. His back against the leather couch, slowly sipping beer. He had his headphones in. From time to time you could see him nodding to a rhythm only he would know. Unapproachable. Waiting perhaps? From his features you could tell that he is not from around here. Your first guess would have been Italian. If he would have had a cigar in his hand, not a cigarette, there would be no doubt. Definitely Italian. For those who know him, he was half Algerian half French, for those who didn’t, he was Danish. He’s been living here for more than 25 years. He can call himself that. The only thing that gives away is his strong accent. An interesting mix of Arabic and French</p>

He talks with passion about his work and how everytime you want to send out supplies to countries in need, you have to filter it  through Copenhagen first. “ For example, there is a disaster in Bolivia, they want syringes. You can ask here [Copenhagen], the supplier, and we pack them, but there are so many scenarios.”<br></p>

He was excited to be a part of change. He considered this approach “something new, something different”, because no matter the background, religion or sexual orientation, algerians have the same scope, fighting together peacefully, against their country’s corrupt system, that he describes as “the mafia”.&nbsp;<br></p>

Tensions, building up since the beginning Bouteflika's rule, rose and the people of Algeria came together in some of the major urban centers. The peaceful protest attracted international media attention and provoked reactions of numourous heads of states. It drove the military to insist on Bouteflika's resignation, which took place on the 2nd of April 2019 and in the following months, several arrests occured, among which Bouteflika's younger brother - Said.</div>

He travelled and lived in almost every continent, now pursuing a bachelor in Copenhagen at DTU. He first came in Denmark at age 11, although he lived some many places after, he still came back and is proud to call Copenhagen home. Olivier has two kids here and a norvegian girlfriend, he was sharing that he would never move to norway for a girl given his children here. <br><br>Olivier stood tall, having an admirable confidence. His golden watch case almost covered his whole hand. His rings set him aside from many men; golden, thick, bold and full of crystals.<br>“He’s a millionaire! He’s a millionaire!” Marc exclaims.<br>A friend in belgium made his jewelry. <br>“It’s diamonds! He’s a millionaire!” Marc insists.<br>They were definitely not diamonds.<br></p>
