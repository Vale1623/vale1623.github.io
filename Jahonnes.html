He then moved towards a chair in the corner, right next to the pool table, sat down, and watched the young men playing. It was clear that he knew many of the people, that he went to the bar often. He looked as he was coming home after a long day’s work. Johannes started talking to one of the guys playing pool, and started giving him advice on how to better his game.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>That’s when I first met Johannes. He agreed upon the interview and invited me to his apartment the next day.</div><div><br></div><div>I arrived at Johannes place at Guldbergsgade in Nørrebro. He invited me in, offered me coffee and we had a piece of cake. The apartment was plastered with posters of influential people that he believed to be important for society in some way.

I have been sober ever since, though it’s really not fun to be sober. I had been to Copenhagen before because I grew up in an Inner Mission home. I had seven siblings. We were eight kids: four boys and four girls. All of them were older than me and had moved out around Fyn. I slowly started distancing myself from the religion I was a part of, not from Christianity but from the Inner Mission. I knew if I ever wanted to live my own life, I had to get away from them. So one day I just packed up and left for Copenhagen.I was about 22-23 years old. I worked for a publisher, and at that time books were sold from door to door. So I went from door to door.There were actually some really nice books I sold.They costed about 30 kr and people could buy them in installments. I mainly sold pictures bibles, stories of Hans Christian Andersen and others alike. They were actually really good products. I have always felt that I only wanted to do things that allowed me to look at myself in the mirror the next day. Suddenly I got sick of listening to myself saying the same sentences over and over again. Some days I was really good, other days I didn't sell anything. I’ve had different days in my fucking life. I even won a sales contest at that place. I just didn't want to repeat myself every day. I also sold a book called the woman and the child. I sold a lot of them to the nurses. I found this nurse housing place. Sometimes I went in on fridays, stuff happened so  I didn't get out until monday morning. I even sold some books while I was there. Iwas a good looking guy when I wore a clean shirt. They succeeded in tempting me. I am, after all, just a man. <br>I moved to Copenhagen to experience the city. I didn't have any big plans, I just wanted to seize the opportunity.<br></p>

                                    <p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text display-7">I used to perform at Betty Nansens teater. We were thirteen older people who had to entertain with stories from their lives. I was kind of their star at that point. I told a story I call “the confrontation”. We were only supposed to do it for a month, but people liked my story, and kept coming there, so it got extended for two more weeks. <br><br>The Confrontation<br><br>‘I had a girlfriend at the time, lets call her Leila. She was amazing, everything I ever needed. We saw each other every Wednesday and on the Weekends. It was the first time in my life that I was monogamous for the first three years of a relationship. I have never tried keeping to one woman before. Leila had a son who got a job in Hong Kong, where he had to live for the next two years with his family. Leila was very sad that her son and grandchildren moved away, so she went to visit them as often as she could, for a few weeks at a time. As if it wasn’t enough that she left me several weeks at a time, she didn’t even leave me with a substitute for her when she left. During the last trip she took, I went to a højskole for a week, where I met another amazing woman, Helene. They told us at the højskole that we needed to live in the moment, and I assure you, Helene and I did. I actually fell in love with her, and forgot all about Leila. Right when I returned from Højskole, Leila returned home as well. I found myself in a very difficult situation. I tried to date both of them for two-three weeks, it was a time where all my needs were satisfied, but I am not comfortable living a lie. Helene knew about Leila all along, so one night I decided to tell Leila about Helene. I told her that I found somebody else, but that I still loved her. I didn’t know what to do, she got very mad, we went through a plethora of  emotions. She kicked me, she kissed me, she cried and she yelled. It was an intense night. The next day Leila decided that she did not want to lose me at any cost. She started making promises, and did everything she could to keep me. It was very hard. You don’t just stop loving somebody because you meet someone new. I told Helene that I told Leila about her, and then without even knowing each other, they started hating each other. Leila talked really badly about Helene when she didn’t even know her. I didn’t know what to do. I told them I would decide within two months. They didn’t like that either. I wanted Leila to see that Helene was a worthy opponent, not just a stupid bitch as she called her. I got sick of them talking trash about each other, so I extended an invitation to both of them: “This Sunday we are all going for lunch at Hansens Familiehave at three pm.” Holy shit. They thought I was crazy for inviting them both, but I told them that this was how it was going to be, and whoever did not show up, had lost me. They both ended up coming that day. On that Sunday, Leila and I picked up Helene at the bus. Leila hugged her when she saw her, telling her that she understood that this must be difficult for her as well. She greeted her in a very nice way. Leila impressed me and earned some extra points by doing that. When we got to the restaurant they were already talking a lot. They were also very similar in age, looks and personality. They were both very beautiful. There was a lot of people who looked at me with envy. The atmosphere was actually very pleasant, we have also had a few glasses of wine at that point. I didn't know what was going on, would they be leaving together? When we were done eating, we took a walk in Frederiksberg Have, and then Helene decided that she wanted to go home. When i saw them together I realized which one of them I held nearest and dearest to my heart. It was Leila. It was a grounded kind of love. I had to choose her. I called Helene the next day, and I didn’t even have to say anything. Helene told me that she could tell that Leila and I were meant to be together. The grounded love won against the summer love. When I made the decision about inviting them out for lunch, I reminded myself of an english phrase I've learned. “Face it” Instead of hiding the truth, I had to face it. I think they appreciated meeting each other and seeing the reason I fell in love with more than one person at a time. They saw that they didn’t just lose to anybody. ‘<br><br>This was five-six years ago. Leila and I are still together.&nbsp;<br></p>

                                    <p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text display-7">I have always tried to simplify my life. I am also a co-founder and chairman for a union called “Big shoes” it is about the mental shoe size we wear. We try to make people look further than the tip of their own nose. our slogan is simplification, clear speech, and not one word more than what we mean. Furthermore we have six basic ideas. <br>We will try to create relationships between generations - we really need it.<br>We want to appeal to people who hold a grudge. It hits you the most. For those who cannot forgive, life is a bigger punishment than death itself. <br>For the greedy: Think about if it makes you happy, or if it adds to your worries and disturbs your sleep.<br>For the stressed: Try to figure out what is most important in your life and focus mainly on that.<br>For “fedtspillerne”: We are worried that you are not having any fun<br>We want to contribute to a better world and try to have fun while we do it. We created the union in 2013, and is still run by the three of us. We decided to call us the triumvirate. We were three men from different generations at a bar, we talked about the larger and smaller problems of the world, and how they are mostly related to people wearing too small shoes (Danish saying, mentally state of mind) So we created the union “Big shoes”. You can even be a member if you want! It will cost you 100kr a year, and 50% goes to charity. Last year we had 140 members, so we had 7000kr we could give to a homeless shelter. The year before we gave almost the same amount to the street lawyers (Gadejuristen). This is our way of giving back to an otherwise cold world. We also have two awards, the big shoe award and the small shoe award. The big shoe award goes to somebody who has distinguished themselves in a positive way in the community. The small shoe award is someone who has distinguished themselves in a foolish or ridiculous way. haha. One year we gave the Big Shoe award to Marta from “Guldsaksen”. She has a heart the size of Kongens Nytorv. She helps so many people in the area, they even made a tv show about her on DR “Marta og Guldsaksen”<br></p>
