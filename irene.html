A little fresh air to breathe in the non ventilated room. I seize the opportunity and take a deep breath.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Irene walks in with a newspaper in one hand, groceries in another. She looks around, giving friendly nods to her acquaintances, accompanied by sincere “Hejsa’s”. Pulling out the wooden chair of the table she put her eyes on, she places down the groceries and newspaper so she can freely order her favourite day drink at the bar; a cup of coffee and a shot of Baileys. Carefully walking back to her designated place so she wouldn’t spill anything, she makes herself comfortable in an otherwise very stiff chair. Irene puts her reading glasses on, preparing herself for her read.</div><div><br></div><div>She’s in her element. Lighting up a cigarette, she is immersing into the newspaper. Today’s newspaper must have been interesting. Irene would forget her cigarette in the ashtray, letting it burn almost to the bud, before emerging from the text. Her noticeably red nails contrasted the white pages of the newspaper that reflected a soft spark as she would turn the pages.</div><div><br></div></div>

                                    <p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text display-7">Irene has been living in Nørrebro since ‘83. “I feel very safe here. I know a lot of other elders are not feeling safe because of the immigrants. I have been living here for such a long time, I have known the young men since before they learned how to walk. They help me, and greet me every time, so I feel completely safe here. Many people are scared of walking around the red square at night because of all the trouble there has been. But as an elderly, there is a great deal of respect from the immigrants, so nothing ever happens to us. I haven't met anyone who wasn't really nice; they offer to help me with my grocery bags.”<br><br>“At home there is a lot of loneliness in the apartments. It’s like a waiting room, I know this. When you are my age, loneliness can kill. and it does that if you are alone. This makes you search for some companionships. That is what the bodegas are there for. They fill a void. It can be a little too social if you are there for too long.”<br><br>Irene had kids early. She was 20 when she had her first child, by the age of 21 the second one came along. She was a single mom at that time. “I met a soldier. He was really handsome, so I had two kids within two years with him.”<br><br>“Nowadays my daughter lives in Reersøe. That’s where the cats have no tail. I know its a bit of a laugh, but they really don’t. There are many cats with tails, but most of them don’t have one. My daughter has three cats, four cows and a chubby husband, so she has enough on her plate. She visits me 3-4 times a month and  we spend time together. But I still think the bodega is for lonely people.”<br></p>

                                    <p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text display-7">She frequently comes to Heimdal’s Bodega, usually after she finished her grocery shopping and right before going to Bingo. She prefers playing Bingo over watching the news, or picking up on a new series. “I don’t like seeing all the horrible things on the news”.<br><br>Irene came to Heimdal’s today as well, right after groceries, just before Bingo. Ordering the same drink like any other day she visits this place. “ I drink coffee and Baileys. Before I used to drink coffee with brandy, but I have to take care of myself. I try to do that as much as I can ”.<br><br>She doesn’t come here that often but has a soft spot to this place. She loves socializing. “Life is about talking to people, not just sitting at home. I would go crazy! [...] It doesn’t matter if you are old or young here, there are always people to talk to, and they don’t care about age”.<br><br>“We talk a lot about sickness and the loss of people in our lives”.<br></p>

I asked him why he was wearing the leather pants and he asked me to look out the window. But I didn't want to. I knew there was a motorbike down on the street. Allan told me ‘I would like to say goodbye to you, while i got you here.’ I hugged my son, and kissed him on the cheek.” <br>Irene started choking up a bit while talking about Allan. She looked up towards the ceiling, took a sip of the Baileys in front of her, and continued her story....<br>“Three months after his visit, he crashed straight into a wall. broke his neck, and died on the spot.” Irene pulled out a picture from her wallet, caressing a picture of her son, then quickly putting it away. “After his passing I went to church for answers, I just couldn't make sense of his death. The Priest told me that my son was too good to be on earth, and heaven needed him.  I asked the question, and I needed to accept the answer that was given. I guess it was better than Allan being in a wheelchair.. Right?”<br>This was the first major loss Irene had to face, but surely not the last loss she had to go through.&nbsp;<br></p>

I lost my fiance of thirty-five years. He lived at a different address and we had been seeing each other every Friday, Saturday and Sunday. He got sick and the last eight years before his death I had been taking care of him. My ex husband called me four years ago, and said ‘mom’. You call mom the mother of your children. So he called me and said ‘Mom, can I come home to you to die?.’ I asked him ‘what are you saying? But yes, you can walk the dog while I'm at Bingo.’ He came to my apartment, where he sat on the couch with the dog that loved him so much. He slept on the couch when I was in the bedroom with my fiance. My fiance died in November four years ago and my ex husband died on the first of March . My ex had cancer and was really close with our dog. I think they gave each other a lot of comfort. They were always sitting together. I think the dog could feel my ex husband's illness. It was horrible when he died, two deaths in four months. I had to put down the dog because of how much it missed my ex husband, it was really grieving. I thought to myself, ‘I'm just sitting here alone now…’ I was sad, I was very sad. Then I went to the church. I asked them if there was anything I could help them with, and luckily there was. <br><br>Every Wednesday and Saturday I go to church at ten am and help out. It lindres the pain in a way. It helped with the loneliness which I felt a lot with the losses I had experienced. I was sad, but it helped me get through it.”<br></p>
